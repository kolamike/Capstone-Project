EXPLORATION OF THE CYCLISTIC BIKE BETWEEN CASUAL RIDERS AND ANNUAL MEMBERS BY SHITTU KOLAWOLE For this project, I analyzed how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. Analyzed the historical bike trip data to identify trends in the usage of bikes by casual and member riders. The project started on an excel spreadsheet. The dataset is made available for each month, thus making 12 CSV files which contains over 5 million observations and 13 fields. The individual dataset was imported into R and merged into a data frame to make the cleaning process easier and Tableau was used for the visualization. RESEARCH QUESTION: How casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bikes differently?
